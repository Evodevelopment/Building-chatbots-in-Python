#In this code, it is assumed that you have an interpreter object that provides the .parse() method to extract the entities from the 
#message. The entities are extracted using interpreter.parse(message)["entities"].

#The code then initializes an empty params dictionary and fills it with the extracted entities, with each entity's name as the key 
#and its value as the value in the dictionary.

#Next, the find_hotels() function is called with the params dictionary to obtain the matching hotel results. 
#The code retrieves the names of the hotels from the results and assigns them to the names list.

#The variable n is determined using the min() function to choose the index for the response. 
#It takes the minimum value between the number of results and 3.

#Finally, the code returns the selected response from the responses list using the .format() method to insert the names of the hotels 
#into the response.

#Please ensure that you have implemented the find_hotels() function and have the responses list defined appropriately.
